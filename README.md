A mini project on Hotel Room Reservation  which was mainly created based on DBMS concepts learnt in 3rd sem using Netbeans and Oracle.
In this project I have used Netbeans for creation of forms and Java for the form actions. This project is just a mini project for internal hotel room reservation 
by the management staff. This project is related only to the database within a company.

The first screen shows about the different menus like customer details,room details, reservation,bill.
On clicking customer details, we can enter the customer id, name,address,gender,age,phone number in the customer database.The staff can view or delete the details also.

On click of room details, the hotel management staff can insert the room nos and room type and the amount they are charging for that room.
The room type is displayed as drop down list.

On click of reservation, the room nos are listed in drop down menu. We can enter the customer id,check in date,check out date and based on that availability of the room will be checked and the room will be booked.
On successful booking,a pop up message will be displayed as Booked Successfully.

On click of bill, the staff can enter the customer id and find the total bill for the respective customer ids.
